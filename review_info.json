Cons \u2022 The bright orange and green colors were the only option available. Even though they look bright and pleasing to the eyes when clean, getting is messy and having stains on it is extremely extremely easy. \u2022 Has white stains on the darker colors of the slippers when wet which could be attributed to the water's quality but still needs to be mentioned.", "helpful_count": 0},
